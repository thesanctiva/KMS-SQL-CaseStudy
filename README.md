# KMS SQL Inventory Analysis (2009–2012)

Welcome! This project is a complete SQL case study I worked on for a fictional company called **Kultra Mega Stores (KMS)**. They specialize in office supplies and furniture, and this analysis covers their historical sales data between **2009 and 2012**.

The goal was to analyze performance across **products, customers, regions, and shipping methods** — and to generate real, actionable business insights that could help the company improve revenue, reduce waste, and make smarter decisions.

## 🔍 What This Project Covers

Over the course of this case study, I explored 11 key business questions, including:

- Which product category brought in the most sales?
- Which customer segment had the highest return rate?
- Are expensive shipping methods being used wisely?
- Who were the most valuable and loyal customers?
- How do different regions perform in terms of revenue?

All questions were solved using SQL queries written in **Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL)**, with some results exported to Excel for further formatting and summaries.

## 💡 Key Insights

Here are just a few things I uncovered:

- **Office Supplies** was the best-selling category overall — a clear winner for future marketing efforts.
- Some **low-priority orders were shipped using Express Air**, the most expensive option. That's a cost leak worth fixing.
- **Corporate clients** contributed the highest overall revenue and consistently ordered office furniture and equipment.
- Certain regions like **Ontario and Quebec** performed exceptionally well, while areas like **Nunavut and Yukon** showed weak sales.
- Several returns came from the **[Segment]** segment — possibly pointing to product quality or delivery issues.

## 📌 Tools Used

- Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL)
- Excel (for results export)
- Word (for the final summary)
- GitHub (to organize and document the project)

## 🧠 What I Learned

This case really helped me practice writing **complex SQL queries**, using **JOINs**, **aggregations**, **GROUP BY**, and **data filtering** to answer real-world business questions. It also challenged me to **think like an analyst** — not just run queries, but interpret the results and explain what they mean for the business.
